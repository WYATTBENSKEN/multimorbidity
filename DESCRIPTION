Description: This package aims to make simple the often duplicative process of implementing
    various comorbidty and multimorbidty measures to claims and other administrative data.
    The functions contained in this package are meant to first prepare the data to a format
    acceptable by all other packages, then provide a uniform and simple approach to
    generate comorbidity and multimorbidity metrics based on these claims data. The package
    is ever evolving to include new metrics, and is always looking for new measures to include.
