# multimorbidity

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of multimorbidity is to create as single package which can take original claims data, clean and organize them to a simple format, which can then be immediately used to obtain any of a number of comorbidity and multimorbidity measures. This package is meant to be a simple and transparent one-stop-shop for those working with claims or other administrative health care data. The measures included in this package have been developed by other researchers and are detailed in depth below.

This package is meant to be both user-friendly and transparent. An individual should feel comfortably understanding what's 'under the hood' with these various metrics and the functions are written in a way that makes this possible.
