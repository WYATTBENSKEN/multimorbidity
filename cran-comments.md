## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added the proper references, in the format instructed, to the DESCRIPTION

* Add /value to the .Rd for each of the functions in the package

* Eliminated the dontrun{} wrapping, by creating a dataset which the functions can be tested/run on

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream Dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
